Thanks for downloading Builder.

To install it, make sure you have Python 3.0 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you need to remove it first.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "builder" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python3.0/site-packages (Unix, Python 3.0)
    C:\\PYTHON30\site-packages         (Windows)
